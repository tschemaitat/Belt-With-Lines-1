Placeable
	Placable_belt
	Balancer

Belt
	defines the belt image
	defines coordinates of items (hold 16 items)
	linked 4 belts around it
	logic
		what shape am I?
		in back is there an input, are they my priority?
	CurveToRight, CurveToLeft, Straight, Balancer_Belt inherit it
Balancer
	takes up 1x2 space
	holds 4 Balancer_Belt's
		they connect to eachother and then to the 4 belts around the balancer
		balancer_belts act like belts and can be put into a list but are smaller
List
	construction
		takes belt as input, looks forward and backward to get a list of item positions
		when it has all the positions, it saves the coordinates and belts they come from
		at the end, it connects with other lists if there is an output
	iterate
		moves items forward, if it is blocked by forward list it can access it to push items forward
	printing
		it stores the belts that the position, when drawing an item, it can access those coordinates
